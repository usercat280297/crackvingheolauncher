I have identified a large block of corrupted code at the end of `src/pages/Store.jsx` (lines 1661-1777), likely caused by a copy-paste error. The code contains severe syntax errors like `HOVER;PPUPCARD`, `hoviredGamev`, and jumbled HTML attributes.

I will fix this by replacing the entire corrupted section with the correct implementation, which includes:

1. **Hover Popup Card**: A properly formatted popup that shows game details (image, rating, description) when hovering over a game.
2. **Pagination Button**: The "Load More Games" button.
3. **CSS Styles**: The `style jsx` block for animations (slideInLeft, fadeInSlow).
4. **Closing Tags**: Ensuring the component and file are properly closed.

**Action:**

* **Edit** **`src/pages/Store.jsx`**: Replace the corrupted text block with the clean, working code.
